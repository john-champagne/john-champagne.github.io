*My wife and I in 2021*


I'm Johnny Champagne, a computer engineer in Huntsville, Alabama. I work professionally as a reverse engineer for **[Dynetics](https://www.dynetics.com/)**.

I got my BS in Electrical Engineering at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and I am currently pursuing an MS in Electrical Engineering at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

My academic interests include digital signal processing, image processing, and data compression. I also enjoy hobbyist electronics, programming, and math.

I use this page to write about math, my projects, or whatever is currently on my mind.
