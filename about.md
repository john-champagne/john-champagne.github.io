title: About
---
I'm Johnny Champagne, a computer engineer from Huntsville, Alabama. I work professionally as a reverse engineer for **[Dynetics](https://www.dynetics.com/)** and I am currently pursuing a master's degree at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

My academic interests include digital signal processing, image processing, and data compression. I also enjoy hobbyist electronics and programming.

My girlfriend (now wife) got tired of me explaining nerdy stuff to her, so I write here now.

Feel free to contact me for any reason. The best way to reach me is via email.
