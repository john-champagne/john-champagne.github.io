*My wife and I in 2022 at the Acadian Village in Lafayette, Louisiana*


I'm Johnny Champagne, an electrical engineer in Huntsville, Alabama. I work professionally as a reverse engineer and section manager for **[Dynetics](https://www.dynetics.com/)**.

  
I have a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (Geaux Cajuns! 🤟) and an MS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Alabama in Huntsville (Go Chargers! 🐎).


My academic interests include digital signal processing, image processing, and data compression. I also enjoy hobbyist electronics, programming, and math.


I use this website to write about math, my projects, or whatever is currently on my mind.
