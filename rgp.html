<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 1</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">1</span> Blessed indeed is the man
<br>
who follows not the counsel of the wicked,<br>
nor stands in the path with sinners,<br>
nor abides in the company of scorners,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> but whose delight is the law of the LORD,
<br>
and who ponders his law day and night.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> He is like a tree that is planted
<br>
beside the flowing waters,<br>
that yields its fruit in due season,<br>
and whose leaves shall never fade;<br>
and all that he does shall prosper.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> Not so are the wicked, not so!
<br>
For they, like winnowed chaff,<br>
shall be driven away by the wind.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> When the wicked are judged they shall not rise,
<br>
nor shall sinners in the council of the just;<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> for the LORD knows the way of the just,
<br>
but the way of the wicked will perish.<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 2</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">1</span> Why do the nations conspire,
<br>
and the peoples plot in vain?<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> They arise, the kings of the earth;
<br>
princes plot against the LORD and his Anointed.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> “Let us burst asunder their fetters.
<br>
Let us cast off from us their chains.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> He who sits in the heavens laughs;
<br>
the LORD derides and mocks them.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> Then he will speak in his anger,
<br>
his rage will strike them with terror.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> “It is I who have appointed my king
<br>
on Sion, my holy mountain.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> I will announce the decree of the LORD:
<br>
The LORD said to me, “You are my Son.<br>
It is I who have begotten you this day.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> Ask of me and I will give you
<br>
the nations as your inheritance,<br>
and the ends of the earth as your possession.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> With a rod of iron you will rule them;
<br>
like a potterʼs jar you will shatter them.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> So now, O kings, understand;
<br>
take warning, rulers of the earth.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> Serve the LORD with fear;
<br>
exult with trembling, pay him your homage,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> lest he be angry and you perish on the way,
<br>
for suddenly his anger will blaze.<br>
Blessed are all who trust in God!<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 3</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> How many are my foes, O LORD!
<br>
How many are rising up against me!<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> How many are saying about me,
<br>
“There is no help for him in God.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> But you, LORD, are a shield about me,
<br>
my glory, who lift up my head.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> I cry aloud to the LORD.
<br>
From his holy mountain he answers me.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> I lie down, I sleep and I wake,
<br>
for the LORD upholds me.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> I will not fear even thousands of people
<br>
who are ranged on every side against me.<br>
Arise, LORD; save me, my God,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> you who strike all my foes on the cheek,
<br>
you who break the teeth of the wicked!<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> Salvation belongs to the LORD;
<br>
may your blessing be on your people!<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 4</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> I called, the God of justice gave me answer;
<br>
from anguish you released me, have mercy and hear me!<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> Children of man, how long will my glory be dishonored,
<br>
will you love what is futile and seek what is false?<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> Know that the LORD works wonders for his faithful one;
<br>
the LORD will hear me whenever I call him.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> Tremble, do not sin: ponder on your bed and be still.
<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> Offer right sacrifice, and trust in the LORD.
<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> “What can bring us happiness?” many say.
<br>
Lift up the light of your face on us, O LORD.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> You have put into my heart a greater joy
<br>
than abundance of grain and new wine can provide.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> In peace I will lie down and fall asleep,
<br>
for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 5</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> To my words give ear, O LORD;
<br>
give heed to my sighs.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> Attend to the sound of my cry,
<br>
my King and my God.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> To you do I pray, O LORD.
<br>
In the morning you hear my voice;<br>
in the morning I plead and watch before you.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> You are no God who delights in evil;
<br>
no sinner is your guest.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> The boastful shall not stand their ground
<br>
before your eyes.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> All who do evil you despise;
<br>
all who lie you destroy.<br>
The deceitful and those who shed blood,<br>
the LORD detests.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> Yet through the greatness of your merciful love,
<br>
I enter your house.<br>
I bow down before your holy temple,<br>
in awe of you.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> Lead me, LORD, in your justice,
<br>
because of my foes;<br>
make straight your way before me.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> No truth can be found in their mouths,
<br>
their heart is all malice,<br>
their throat a wide-open grave;<br>
with their tongue they flatter.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> Declare them guilty, O God.
<br>
Let them fail in their designs.<br>
Drive them out for their many transgressions,<br>
for against you have they rebelled.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> All who take refuge in you shall be glad,
<br>
and ever cry out their joy.<br>
You shelter them; in you they rejoice,<br>
those who love your name.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">13</span> It is you who bless the just one, O LORD;
<br>
you surround him with your favor like a shield.<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 6</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger;
<br>
reprove me not in your rage.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> Have mercy on me, LORD, for I languish.
<br>
LORD, heal me; my bones are shaking,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> and my soul is greatly shaken.
<br>
But you, O LORD, how long?<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> Return, LORD, rescue my soul.
<br>
Save me in your merciful love.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> For in death there is no remembrance of you;
<br>
from the grave, who can give you praise?<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> I am exhausted with my groaning;
<br>
every night I drench my bed with tears,<br>
I bedew my couch with weeping.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> My eyes waste away with grief;
<br>
I have grown old surrounded by all my foes.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> Leave me, all who do evil,
<br>
for the LORD heeds the sound of my weeping.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> The LORD has heard my plea;
<br>
the LORD will receive my prayer.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> All my foes will be shamed and greatly shaken,
<br>
suddenly put to shame.<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 7</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> O LORD, my God, I take refuge in you.
<br>
Save and rescue me from all my pursuers,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> lest they tear me apart like a lion,
<br>
and drag me off with no one to rescue me.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> If I have done this, O LORD, my God,
<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> if I have paid back evil for good,
<br>
I who saved my unjust oppressor:<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> then let my foe pursue my soul and seize me;
<br>
let him trample my life to the ground,<br>
and lay my honor in the dust.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> O LORD, rise up in your anger;
<br>
be exalted against the fury of my foes.<br>
Awake, my God, to enact<br>
the justice you ordered.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> Let the company of peoples gather round you,
<br>
as you take your seat above them on high.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> The LORD is judge of the peoples.
<br>
Give judgment for me, O LORD,<br>
for I am just and blameless of heart.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> Put an end to the evil of the wicked!
<br>
Make the just man stand firm;<br>
it is you who test mind and heart,<br>
O God of justice!<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> God is a shield before me,
<br>
who saves the upright of heart.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> God is a judge, just and powerful and patient,
<br>
not exercising anger every day.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">13</span> Against someone who does not repent,
<br>
God will sharpen his sword;<br>
he bends his bow and makes ready.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">14</span> For such a one he prepares deadly weapons;
<br>
he barbs his arrows with fire.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">15</span> Here is one who conceives iniquity;
<br>
pregnant with malice, he gives birth to lies.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">16</span> He digs a pit and bores it deep;
<br>
and in the trap he has made he falls.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">17</span> His malice recoils on his head;
<br>
on his own skull his violence falls.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">18</span> I thank the LORD for his justice,
<br>
singing to the name of the LORD, the Most High.<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 8</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> O LORD, our Lord, how majestic
<br>
is your name through all the earth!<br>
Your majesty is set above the heavens.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> From the mouths of children and of babes
<br>
you fashioned praise to foil your enemy,<br>
to silence the foe and the rebel.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> When I see the heavens, the work of your fingers,
<br>
the moon and the stars which you arranged,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> what is man that you should keep him in mind,
<br>
the son of man that you care for him?<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> Yet you have made him little lower than the angels;
<br>
with glory and honor you crowned him,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> gave him power over the works of your hands:
<br>
you put all things under his feet,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> All of them, sheep and oxen,
<br>
yes, even the cattle of the fields,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> birds of the air, and fish of the sea
<br>
that make their way through the waters.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> O LORD, our Lord, how majestic
<br>
is your name through all the earth!<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 9</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> I will praise you, LORD, with all my heart;
<br>
all your wonders I will confess.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> I will rejoice in you and be glad,
<br>
and sing Psalms to your name, O Most High.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> See how my enemies turn back,
<br>
how they stumble and perish before you.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> You upheld the justice of my cause;
<br>
you sat enthroned, an upright judge.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> You have rebuked the nations, destroyed the wicked;
<br>
you have wiped out their name forever and ever.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> The foe is destroyed, eternally ruined.
<br>
You uprooted their cities; their memory has perished.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> But the LORD sits enthroned forever;
<br>
he has set up his throne for judgment.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> He will judge the world with justice;
<br>
he will govern the peoples with equity.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> For the oppressed, the LORD will be a stronghold,
<br>
a stronghold in times of distress.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> Those who know your name will trust you;
<br>
you will not forsake those who seek you, O LORD.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> Sing Psalms to the LORD who dwells in Sion.
<br>
Tell his mighty works among the peoples,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">13</span> for the Avenger of Blood has remembered them,
<br>
has not forgotten the cry of the poor.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">14</span> Have mercy on me, O LORD;
<br>
see how I suffer from my foes,<br>
you who raise me from the gates of death,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">15</span> that I may recount all your praise
<br>
at the gates of daughter Sion,<br>
and rejoice in your salvation.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">16</span> The nations have fallen in the pit which they made;
<br>
their feet have been caught in the snare they laid.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">17</span> The LORD has revealed himself; he has given judgment.
<br>
The wicked are snared by the work of their hands.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">18</span> Let the wicked go down to the grave,
<br>
all the nations forgetful of God:<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">19</span> for the needy shall not always be forgotten,
<br>
nor the hopes of the poor ever perish.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">20</span> Arise, O LORD, let human strength not prevail!
<br>
Let the nations be judged before you.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">21</span> Strike them with terror, O LORD;
<br>
let the nations know they are but men.<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 10</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">1</span> O LORD, why do you stand afar off,
<br>
and hide yourself in times of distress?<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> The poor are devoured by the pride of the wicked;
<br>
they are caught in the schemes that others have made.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> For the wicked boasts of his soulʼs desires;
<br>
the covetous blasphemes and spurns the LORD.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> The wicked says in his pride, “God will not punish.
<br>
There is no God.” Such are his thoughts.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> His path is ever untroubled;
<br>
your judgments are on high, far removed.<br>
All those who oppose him, he derides.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> In his heart he thinks, “Never shall I falter;
<br>
never shall misfortune be my lot.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> His mouth is full of cursing, guile, oppression;
<br>
under his tongue are deceit and evil.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> He sits in ambush in the villages;
<br>
in hidden places, he murders the innocent.<br>
The eyes of the wicked keep watch for the helpless.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> He lurks in hiding like a lion in his lair;
<br>
he lurks in hiding to seize the poor;<br>
he seizes the poor one and drags him away.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> He crouches, preparing to spring,
<br>
and the helpless fall prey to his strength.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> He says in his heart, “God forgets,
<br>
he hides his face, never will he see.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> Arise, O LORD; lift up your hand, O God!
<br>
Do not forget the poor!<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">13</span> Why should the wicked spurn God,
<br>
saying in his heart, “You will not call to account”?<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">14</span> But you have seen the trouble and sorrow.
<br>
You note it; you take it in your hands.<br>
The helpless one relies on you,<br>
for you are the helper of the orphan.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">15</span> Break the arm of the wicked and the sinner!
<br>
Pursue their wickedness till nothing remains!<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">16</span> The LORD is king forever and ever.
<br>
The nations shall perish from his land.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">17</span> O LORD, you have heard the desire of the poor.
<br>
You strengthen their hearts; you turn your ear<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">18</span> to give right judgment for the orphan and oppressed,
<br>
so that no one on earth may strike terror again.<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 11</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">1</span> In the LORD I have taken refuge.
<br>
How can you say to my soul,<br>
“Fly like a bird to the mountain!<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> Look, the wicked are bending their bow!
<br>
They are fixing their arrow on the string,<br>
to shoot the upright of heart in the dark.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> Foundations once destroyed,
<br>
what can the just man do?”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> The LORD is in his holy temple;
<br>
the throne of the LORD is in heaven.<br>
His eyes behold the world;<br>
his gaze probes the children of men.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> The LORD inspects the just and the wicked;
<br>
the lover of violence he hates.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> He sends fire and brimstone on the wicked,
<br>
a scorching wind to fill their cup.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> For the LORD is just and loves deeds of justice;
<br>
the upright shall behold his face.<br>

<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 12</div>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> Save me, O LORD, for the holy ones are no more;
<br>
the faithful have vanished from the sons of men.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> They babble vanities, one to another,
<br>
with cunning lips, with divided heart.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> May the LORD destroy all cunning lips,
<br>
the tongue that utters boastful words,<br>

<span class="verse">5</span> those who say, “We prevail with our tongue;
<br>
our lips are our own, who is our master?”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> “For the poor who are oppressed and the needy who groan,
<br>
now will I arise,” says the LORD;<br>
“I will grant them the salvation for which they long.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> The words of the LORD are words without alloy,
<br>
silver from the furnace, seven times refined.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> It is you, O LORD, who will keep us safe,
<br>
and protect us forever from this generation.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> The wicked prowl on every side,
<br>
while baseness is exalted by the sons of men.<br>

<div class="psalm-header">Psalm 13</div>

<span class="verse">2</span> How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever?
<br>
How long will you hide your face from me?<br>

How long shall my enemy prevail over me?<br>

<br>
Let my heart rejoice in your salvation.<br>

I will sing Psalms to the name of the LORD Most High.<br>

Their deeds are corrupt, depraved;<br>
no one does any good.<br>

<span class="verse">2</span> Let God arise; let his foes be scattered.
<br>
Let those who hate him flee from his presence.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away;
<br>
like wax that melts before the fire,<br>
so the wicked shall perish at the presence of God.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> But the just shall rejoice at the presence of God;
<br>
they shall exult with glad rejoicing.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> O sing to God; make music to his name.
<br>
Extol the One who rides on the clouds.<br>
The LORD is his name; exult at his presence.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> Father of orphans, defender of widows:
<br>
such is God in his holy place.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> God gives the desolate a home to dwell in;
<br>
he leads the prisoners forth into prosperity,<br>
but rebels must dwell in a parched land.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> O God, when you went forth before your people,
<br>
when you marched out across the desert,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> the earth trembled, heavens poured down rain:
<br>
at the face of God, the God of Sinai,<br>
at the face of God, the God of Israel.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> You poured down, O God, a generous rain;
<br>
when your people languished, you restored their inheritance.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> It was there that your flock began to dwell.
<br>
In your goodness, O God, you provided for the poor.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> The LORD announces the command;
<br>
a mighty throng bears good tidings:<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">13</span> “The kings and armies are in headlong flight,
<br>
while you were at rest among the sheepfolds.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">14</span> At home the women already share the spoil.
<br>
They are covered with silver as the wings of a dove,<br>
its feathers brilliant with shining gold.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">15</span> When the Almighty scatters kings on the mountain,
<br>
it is like snow whitening Mount Zalmon.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">16</span> You, mountain of Bashan, are a mighty mountain;
<br>
a many-peaked mountain, the mountain of Bashan.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">17</span> Why look with envy, you many-peaked mountain,
<br>
at the mountain where God has desired to dwell?<br>
It is there that the LORD shall dwell forever.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">18</span> The chariots of God are thousands upon thousands.
<br>
The LORD has come from Sinai to the holy place.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">19</span> You have ascended on high; leading captivity captive
<br>
as tribute receiving prisoners, O God,<br>
so that even rebels may dwell near the LORD God.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">20</span> Day after day, may the LORD be blest.
<br>
He bears our burdens; God is our savior.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">21</span> This God of ours is a God who saves.
<br>
The LORD our LORD provides an escape from death.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">22</span> And God will smite the head of his foes,
<br>
the hairy crown of him who walks about in his guilt.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">23</span> The LORD said, “I will bring them back from Bashan;
<br>
I will bring them back from the depth of the sea.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">24</span> Then you will bathe your feet in their blood,
<br>
and the tongues of your dogs take their share of the foe.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">25</span> They see your solemn procession, O God,
<br>
the procession of my God, of my king, to the holy place:<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">26</span> the singers in the forefront, the musicians coming last;
<br>
between them, maidens sounding their timbrels.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">27</span> “In the sacred assembly, bless God, the LORD,
<br>
O you who are from the fountain of Israel.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">28</span> There is Benjamin, least of the tribes, at the head;
<br>
Judahʼs princes, a mighty throng;<br>
Zebulunʼs princes, Naphtaliʼs princes.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">29</span> Summon forth your might, O God;
<br>
your might, O God, which you have shown for us.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">30</span> From your temple high in Jerusalem,
<br>
kings will come to you bringing their tribute.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">31</span> Rebuke the wild beast that dwells in the reeds,
<br>
the bands of the mighty and rulers of the peoples.<br>
Scatter the peoples who delight in war.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">32</span> Rich merchants will make their way from Egypt;
<br>
Ethiopia will stretch out her hands to God.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">33</span> You kingdoms of the earth, sing to God, praise the LORD
<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">34</span> who rides on the heavens, the ancient heavens.
<br>
Behold, he thunders his voice, his mighty voice.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">35</span> Come, acknowledge the power of God.
<br>
His glory is on Israel; his might is in the skies.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">36</span> Awesome is God in his holy place.
<br>
He is God, the God of Israel.<br>
He himself gives strength and power to his people.<br>
Blest be God!<br>

have risen to my neck.<br>

<span class="verse">3</span> I have sunk into the mud of the deep,
<br>
where there is no foothold.<br>
I have entered the waters of the deep,<br>
where the flood overwhelms me.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> I am wearied with crying aloud;

my throat is parched.<br>
My eyes are wasted away<br>
with waiting for my God.<br>

<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> O God, you know my folly;

that shame has covered my face.<br>

a stranger to the children of my mother.<br>

<span class="verse">10</span> Zeal for your house consumes me,
<br>
and taunts against you fall on me.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> When my soul wept bitterly in fasting,
<br>
they made it a taunt against me.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> When I made my clothing sackcloth,

I became a reproach to them,<br>

<span class="verse">13</span> the gossip of those at the gates,

the theme of drunkards<br>

<br>
for a time of your favor.<br>
In your great mercy, answer me, O God,<br>
with your salvation that never fails.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">15</span> Rescue me from sinking in the mud;
<br>
from those who hate me, deliver me.<br>
Save me from the waters of the deep,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">16</span> lest the waves overwhelm me.
<br>
Let not the deep engulf me,<br>
nor the pit close its mouth on me.<br>

<span class="verse">17</span> LORD, answer, for your mercy is kind;
<br>
in your great compassion, turn towards me.<br>

<span class="verse">18</span> Do not hide your face from your servant;

answer me quickly, for I am in distress.<br>

ransom me because of my foes.<br>

my oppressors are all before you.<br>

here I am in anguish.<br>
I looked for solace, but there was none;<br>
for consolers—not one could I find.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">22</span> For food they gave me gall;
<br>
in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<br>

<span class="verse">23</span> Let their table be a snare to them,

and for their friends, a trap.<br>

<span class="verse">24</span> Let their eyes grow dim and blind;

let their limbs continually tremble.<br>

<span class="verse">25</span> Pour out your anger upon them;

let your burning fury overtake them.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">26</span> Let their camp be left desolate;
<br>
let no one dwell in their tents:<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">27</span> for they persecute one whom you struck;

they increase the pain of one whom you wounded.<br>

<span class="verse">28</span> Charge them with guilt upon guilt;
<br>
let them have no share in your justice.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">29</span> Blot them out from the book of the living;

more than a bull with horns and hoofs.<br>

and God-seeking hearts will revive;<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">34</span> for the LORD listens to the needy,

the glories of the LORD and his might,<br>

<span class="verse">5</span> He established a decree in Jacob;

in Israel he set up a law.<br>
To our fathers he gave a command<br>
to make it known to their children,<br>

the children yet to be born.<br>

the wondrous works he had shown them.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> He did wonders in the sight of their fathers,

in Egypt, in the plains of Zoan.<br>

<span class="verse">13</span> He divided the sea and led them through,
<br>
and made the waters stand up like a wall.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">14</span> By day he led them with a cloud;
<br>
throughout the night, with a light of fire.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">15</span> He split the rocks in the desert.
<br>
He gave them plentiful drink, as from the deep.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">16</span> He made streams flow out from the rock,
<br>
and made waters run down like rivers.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">17</span> Yet still they sinned against him,
<br>
rebelled against the Most High in the desert.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">18</span> In their heart they put God to the test
<br>
by demanding the food they craved.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">19</span> They spoke against God and said:
<br>
“Can God spread a table in the wilderness?<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">20</span> See, he struck the rock:
<br>
water gushed forth and swept down in torrents.<br>
But can he also give us bread?<br>
Can he provide meat for his people?”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">21</span> When he heard this, the LORD was angry.
<br>
A fire was kindled against Jacob;<br>
his anger rose against Israel.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">22</span> For they had no faith in God,
<br>
and did not trust his saving power.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">23</span> Yet he commanded the clouds above,
<br>
and opened the gates of heaven.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">24</span> He rained down manna to eat,
<br>
and gave them bread from heaven.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">25</span> Man ate the bread of angels.
<br>
He sent them abundance of food;<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">26</span> the east wind he stirred up in the heavens,
<br>
the south wind he directed by his might.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">27</span> He rained flesh upon them like dust,
<br>
winged fowl like the sands of the sea.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">28</span> He let it fall in the midst of their camp,
<br>
and all around their tents.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">29</span> So they ate and had their fill,
<br>
what they craved, he gave them.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">30</span> But before they had sated their hunger,
<br>
while the food was still in their mouths,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">31</span> Godʼs anger rose against them.
<br>
He slew the strongest among them,<br>
struck down the flower of Israel.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">32</span> Despite all this, they kept on sinning;
<br>
they failed to believe in his wonders.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">33</span> So he ended their days like a breath,
<br>
and their years in sudden terror.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">34</span> When he slew them, then they sought him,
<br>
repented and earnestly sought God.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">35</span> They would remember that God was their rock,
<br>
God the Most High their redeemer.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">36</span> Yet they deceived him with their mouths;
<br>
they lied to him with their tongues.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">37</span> For their hearts were not steadfast toward him;
<br>
they were not faithful to his covenant.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">38</span> Yet he who is full of compassion
<br>
forgave them their sin and spared them.<br>
So often he held back his anger,<br>
and did not stir up all his rage.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">39</span> He remembered they were only flesh,
<br>
a breath that passes, never to return.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">40</span> They rebelled against him often in the desert,
<br>
and caused him pain in the wasteland!<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">41</span> Yet again they turned and tested God;
<br>
they provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">42</span> They failed to remember his deeds
<br>
on the day he saved them from the foe,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">43</span> when he worked his signs in Egypt,
<br>
his wonders in the plains of Zoan.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">44</span> He turned their rivers into blood;
<br>
they could not drink from their streams.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">45</span> He sent swarms of insects to devour them,
<br>
and frogs to destroy them.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">46</span> He gave their crops to insects,
<br>
the fruit of their labor to the locust.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail,
<br>
their sycamore trees with frost.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">48</span> He gave up their cattle to hail,
<br>
their herds to darts of lightning.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">49</span> He unleashed on them the heat of his anger,
<br>
fury, rage, and havoc,<br>
a troop of destroying angels.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">50</span> He leveled a path for his anger.
<br>
He did not spare their lives from death,<br>
but gave their livestock to the plague.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">51</span> He struck all the firstborn in Egypt,
<br>
the first vigor of youth from the dwellings of Ham.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">52</span> Then he brought forth his people like sheep;
<br>
like a flock he led them in the desert.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">53</span> He led them safely with nothing to fear,
<br>
while the sea engulfed their foes.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">54</span> So he brought them to his holy land,
<br>
to the mountain his right hand had won.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">55</span> He drove out the nations before them,
<br>
and apportioned to each their heritage.<br>
The tribes of Israel he settled in their tents.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">56</span> With defiance they tested God Most High;
<br>
they refused to obey his decrees.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">57</span> They strayed, faithless like their fathers;
<br>
they betrayed him like a treacherous bow.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">58</span> They provoked God to wrath with their high places,
<br>
made him jealous with the idols they served.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">59</span> God heard this and was filled with fury;
<br>
he utterly rejected Israel.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">60</span> He forsook his dwelling place in Shiloh,
<br>
the tent where he dwelt with man.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">61</span> He gave his strength into captivity,
<br>
his splendor to the hands of the foe.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">62</span> He gave up his people to the sword,
<br>
and showed his anger against his heritage.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">63</span> So fire devoured their young men,
<br>
their maidens had no wedding songs;<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">64</span> their priests fell by the sword,
<br>
and their widows made no lament.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">65</span> Then the LORD awoke as if from sleep,
<br>
like a warrior maddened by wine.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">66</span> He struck his foes from behind,
<br>
and put them to shame forever.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">67</span> He rejected the tent of Joseph.
<br>
He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">68</span> but he chose the tribe of Judah,
<br>
the mountain of Sion which he loves.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">69</span> He built his shrine like the heavens,
<br>
or like the earth which he founded forever.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">70</span> And he chose his servant David,
<br>
and took him away from the sheepfolds.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">71</span> From the care of the ewes he brought him
<br>
to be shepherd of Jacob his people,<br>
of Israel his own possession.<br>
<br>

with his skillful hands he led them.<br>

<br>
O LORD my God, how great you are,<br>
clothed in majesty and honor,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">2</span> wrapped in light as with a robe!
<br>
You stretch out the heavens like a tent.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">3</span> On the waters you establish your dwelling.
<br>
You make the clouds your chariot;<br>
you ride on the wings of the wind.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">4</span> You make the winds your messengers,
<br>
flame and fire your servants.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">5</span> You set the earth on its foundation,
<br>
immovable from age to age.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> You wrapped it with the depths like a cloak;
<br>
the waters stood higher than the mountains.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> At your threat they took to flight;
<br>
at the voice of your thunder they fled.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> The mountains rose, the valleys descended,

to the place which you had appointed them.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> You set limits they might not pass,

<span class="verse">10</span> You make springs gush forth in the valleys;

they flow in between the hills.<br>

the wild asses quench their thirst.<br>

<span class="verse">12</span> There the birds of heaven build their nests;

from the branches they sing their song.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">13</span> From your dwelling you water the hills;
<br>
by your works the earth has its fill.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">14</span> You make the grass grow for the cattle

and plants to serve mankindʼs need.<br>
That he may bring forth bread from the earth<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">15</span> and wine to cheer the heart;

oil, to make faces shine,<br>

<br>
<span class="verse">18</span> For the goats the lofty mountains,

for the rabbits the rocks are a refuge.<br>

<span class="verse">19</span> You made the moon to mark the months;

the sun knows the time for its setting.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">20</span> You spread the darkness, it is night,
<br>
and all the beasts of the forest creep forth.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">21</span> The young lions roar for their prey,
<br>
and seek their food from God.<br>

<span class="verse">22</span> At the rising of the sun they gather;

and they go to lie down in their dens.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">23</span> Man goes forth to his work,
<br>
to labor till evening falls.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">24</span> How many are your works, O LORD!
<br>
In wisdom you have made them all.<br>
The earth is full of your creatures.<br>

<span class="verse">25</span> Vast and wide is the span of the sea,
<br>
with its creeping things past counting,<br>
living things great and small.<br>

<span class="verse">26</span> The ships are moving there,

you open wide your hand, they are well filled.<br>

you take away their breath, they die,<br>
returning to the dust from which they came.<br>

<span class="verse">7</span> he, the LORD, is our God;

his judgments are in all the earth.<br>

<span class="verse">9</span> the covenant he made with Abraham,
<br>
the oath he swore to Isaac.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> He confirmed it for Jacob as a law,
<br>
for Israel as a covenant forever,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> saying, “I will give you the land of Canaan
<br>
to be your allotted inheritance.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> When they were few in number,
<br>
a handful of strangers in the land,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">13</span> when they wandered from nation to nation,
<br>
from one kingdom and people to another,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">14</span> He allowed no one to oppress them;
<br>
he admonished kings on their account,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">15</span> saying, “Those I have anointed, do not touch;
<br>
do no harm to any of my prophets.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">16</span> But he called down a famine on the land;
<br>
he broke their staff of bread.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">17</span> He had sent a man ahead of them,
<br>
Joseph, sold as a slave.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">18</span> His feet were weighed down in chains,
<br>
his neck was bound with iron,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">19</span> until what he said came to pass,
<br>
and the word of the LORD proved him true.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">20</span> Then the king sent orders and released him;
<br>
the ruler of the peoples set him free.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">21</span> He made him master of his house
<br>
and ruler of all his possessions,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">22</span> to instruct his princes from his heart,
<br>
and to teach his elders wisdom.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">23</span> So Israel came into Egypt;
<br>
Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">24</span> He gave his people great increase;
<br>
he made them stronger than their foes,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">25</span> whose hearts he turned to hate his people,
<br>
and to deal deceitfully with his servants.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">26</span> Then he sent Moses his servant,
<br>
and Aaron whom he had chosen.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">27</span> They performed Godʼs signs among them,
<br>
and his wonders in the land of Ham.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">28</span> He sent darkness, and dark was made,
<br>
but they rebelled against his words.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">29</span> He turned their waters into blood,
<br>
and caused their fish to die.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">30</span> Their land was overrun by frogs,
<br>
even to the halls of their kings.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">31</span> He spoke; there came swarms of flies,
<br>
and gnats covered all the country.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">32</span> He sent hailstones in place of the rain,
<br>
and lightning flashing in their land.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">33</span> He struck their vines and fig trees;
<br>
he shattered the trees through their country.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">34</span> He spoke; the locusts came forth,
<br>
young locusts, too many to be counted.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">35</span> They ate up every plant in the land;

they ate up all the fruit of their fields.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">36</span> He struck all the firstborn in their land,
<br>
the first fruit of all their strength.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">37</span> He led out Israel with silver and gold.
<br>
In his tribes were none who stumbled.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">38</span> Egypt rejoiced when they left,
<br>
for dread had fallen upon them.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">39</span> He spread a cloud as a screen,
<br>
and fire to illumine the night.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">40</span> When they asked he sent them quails;
<br>
he filled them with bread from heaven.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">41</span> He pierced the rock and water gushed forth;
<br>
it flowed as a river in the desert.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">42</span> For he remembered his holy word,
<br>
spoken to Abraham his servant.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">43</span> So he brought out his people with joy,
<br>
his chosen ones with shouts of rejoicing.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">44</span> And he gave them the lands of the nations.
<br>
Of other peoples they possessed the toil,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">45</span> that thus they might keep his precepts,
<br>
that thus they might observe his laws.<br>

<span class="verse">6</span> Like our fathers, we have sinned.
<br>
We have done wrong; our deeds have been evil.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> Our forebears, when they were in Egypt,
<br>
did not grasp the meaning of your wonders.<br>
They forgot the great number of your mercies,<br>
at the Red Sea defied the Most High.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">8</span> Yet he saved them for the sake of his name,
<br>
in order to make known his power.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">9</span> He rebuked the Red Sea; it dried up,
<br>
and he led them through the deep as through the desert.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">10</span> He saved them from the hand of the foe;
<br>
he freed them from the grip of the enemy.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">11</span> The waters covered their oppressors;
<br>
not one of them was left.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">12</span> Then they believed in his words;
<br>
then they sang his praises.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">13</span> But they soon forgot his deeds,
<br>
and would not wait upon his counsel.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">14</span> They yielded to their cravings in the desert,
<br>
and put God to the test in the wilderness.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">15</span> He granted them the favor they asked,
<br>
but struck them with a wasting disease.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">16</span> In the camp, they were jealous of Moses,
<br>
and also Aaron, who was holy to the LORD.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
<br>
and buried the clan of Abiram.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">18</span> Fire blazed up against their clan,
<br>
and flames devoured the wicked.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">19</span> They fashioned a calf at Horeb,
<br>
and worshiped an image of metal;<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">20</span> they exchanged their glory
<br>
for the image of a bull that eats grass.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">21</span> They forgot the God who was their savior,
<br>
who had done such great things in Egypt,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">22</span> such wonders in the land of Ham,
<br>
such marvels at the Red Sea.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">23</span> For this he said he would destroy them,
<br>
but Moses, the man he had chosen,<br>
stood in the breach before him,<br>
to turn back his anger from destruction.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">24</span> Then they scorned the desirable land;
<br>
they had no faith in his word.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">25</span> They complained inside their tents,
<br>
and did not listen to the voice of the LORD.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">26</span> So he raised his hand to them and swore
<br>
that he would lay them low in the desert,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">27</span> would disperse their descendants through the nations
<br>
and scatter them throughout the lands.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">28</span> They bowed before the Baal of Peor,
<br>
ate offerings made to lifeless gods.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">29</span> They roused the LORD to anger with their deeds,
<br>
and a plague broke out among them.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">30</span> Then Phinehas stood up and intervened.
<br>
Thus the plague was ended,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">31</span> and this was counted to him as righteous
<br>
from age to age forever.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">32</span> They provoked him at the waters of Meribah.
<br>
Through their fault it went ill with Moses,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">33</span> for they made his spirit grow bitter,
<br>
and he uttered words that were rash.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">34</span> They failed to destroy the peoples,
<br>
as the LORD had commanded them;<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">35</span> instead they mingled with the nations,
<br>
and learned to act as they did.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">36</span> They also served their idols,
<br>
and these became a snare to entrap them.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">37</span> They even offered their sons
<br>
and their daughters in sacrifice to demons.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">38</span> They poured out innocent blood,
<br>
the blood of their sons and daughters,<br>
whom they offered to the idols of Canaan.<br>
The land was polluted with blood.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">39</span> So they defiled themselves by their actions;
<br>
their deeds were those of a harlot.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">40</span> Then Godʼs anger blazed against his people;
<br>
he was filled with horror at his heritage.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">41</span> So he handed them over to the nations,
<br>
and their foes became their rulers.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">42</span> Their enemies also oppressed them;
<br>
they were subdued beneath their hand.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">43</span> Time after time he rescued them,
<br>
but in their malice they dared to defy him<br>
and were weakened even more by their guilt.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">44</span> In spite of this he paid heed to their distress,
<br>
so often as he heard their cry.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">45</span> For their sake he remembered his covenant.
<br>
In the greatness of his mercy, he relented,<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">46</span> and he let them be treated with compassion
<br>
by all who held them captive.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">47</span> Save us, O LORD our God!

is to obey your words.”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">58</span> With all my heart I implore your favor;

<br>
Teach me your statutes.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">65</span> O LORD, you have been good to your servant,

according to your word.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">66</span> Teach me good judgment and knowledge,

<br>
<span class="verse">67</span> Before I was humbled, I strayed,

teach me your statutes.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">69</span> The arrogant smear me with lies;
<br>
with all my heart I keep your precepts.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">70</span> Their heart is dense like fat,
<br>
but your law is my delight.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">71</span> It was good for me to be humbled,
<br>
that I might learn your statutes.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">72</span> The law from your mouth means more to me
<br>
than large quantities of silver and gold.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">73</span> It was your hands that made me and shaped me;
<br>
grant me insight to learn your commands.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">74</span> Those who revere you see me and rejoice,

though I am humbled, you are just.<br>

by your promise to your servant.<br>

that I may not be put to shame.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">81</span> My soul yearns for your salvation;
<br>
I hope in your word.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">82</span> My eyes yearn to see your promise.

I ask, “When will you comfort me?”<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">83</span> I am like a wineskin shriveled by smoke,

<span class="verse">84</span> How long must your servant endure?
<br>
When will you bring judgment on my foes?<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">85</span> For me the proud have dug pitfalls;
<br>
they defy your law.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">86</span> Your commands are all true; then help me
<br>
when lies oppress me.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">87</span> They have almost made an end of me on earth,
<br>
yet I forsake not your precepts.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">88</span> In your merciful love, give me life;
<br>
I will obey the decrees of your lips.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">89</span> Forever is your word, O LORD,
<br>
standing firm in the heavens.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">90</span> From age to age is your truth;
<br>
like the earth, it stands firm.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">91</span> Your judgments endure to this day,
<br>
for all things are your servants.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">92</span> Had your law not been my delight,

I would have died in my affliction.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">93</span> I will never forget your precepts,

but your command is boundless.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">97</span> O LORD, how I love your law:
<br>
my meditation all the day!<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">98</span> Your command makes me wiser than my foes,
<br>
for it is with me always.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">99</span> I have more insight than all who teach me,

<br>
<span class="verse">101</span> I keep my feet from every evil path,

to obey your word.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">102</span> I have not turned away from your decrees,

which you yourself have taught me.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">103</span> How sweet is your promise to my tongue,

more than honey in the mouth.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">104</span> I gain understanding from your precepts,

and so I hate all false ways.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">105</span> Your word is a lamp for my feet,

<span class="verse">106</span> I have sworn an oath and affirmed it,

But you, O LORD, know my path.<br>
On the way where I shall walk,<br>
they have hidden a snare to entrap me.<br>

there is no one who pays me heed.<br>
No escape remains open to me;<br>

I muse on what your hand has wrought,<br>

<br>
Like a parched land my soul thirsts for you.<br>
<br>
<span class="verse">7</span> O LORD, make haste and answer me,

Do not hide your face from me,<br>
